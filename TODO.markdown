Need to implement and describe the following:
- A better counter.
- Types for COOL expressions.
- A concise COOL expression parser with good error messages.
- Tests for the parser based on expressions from the examples.
- Tests based on randomly generated expressions.

Need to implement and describe code to randomly generate:
- All expressions of a given depth.
- Random expression trees of varying depth and breadth.
- All type checked expressions of a given depth.
- Type checked random expressions.

Maybe include class definitions in the parser and generators.

Maybe use a Haskell implementation of [miniKanren](https://github.com/sergv/hkanren)?
